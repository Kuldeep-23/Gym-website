                <h2>Squats:</h2>
                <ul>
                    How to: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, chest up, and core engaged. Lower your hips as if you're sitting in a chair, keeping your back straight. Ensure your knees track over your toes. Go as low as comfortable, ideally until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push through your heels to return to the starting position.   
                </ul>

                <h2> PUSH-UPS </h2>
                <ul>
                    How to: Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing forward. Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping your body in a straight line. Push back up to the starting position. You can modify this by doing knee push-ups if needed. 
                </ul>
