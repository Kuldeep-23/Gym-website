                <h2>Squats:</h2>
                <ul>
                    How to: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, chest up, and core engaged. Lower your hips as if you're sitting in a chair, keeping your back straight. Ensure your knees track over your toes. Go as low as comfortable, ideally until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Push through your heels to return to the starting position.
                </ul>

                <h2>Push-ups:</h2>
                <ul>
                    A standard pushup is the more challenging version of a knee pushup.
Assume a high plank position and complete the pushup in the same way, allowing your elbows to flare out at a 45-degree angle.
                </ul>

                <h2>Bridge:</h2>
                <ul>
                    Activate your core and posterior chain (backside of your body) with a bridge. This is a great exercise to use as a warmup.Directions:
Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your arms extended by your sides.
Pushing through your feet and bracing your core, raise your bottom off the ground until your hips are fully extended, squeezing your glutes at the top.
Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.

                <h2>Bicycle:</h2>
                <ul>
                    Bicycle crunches directly target the rectus abdominis, also known as the “six pack.”
                    Directions:
Lie on your back and bring your legs to a tabletop position. Bend your elbows, and put your hands behind your head.
Crunch up and bring your right elbow to your left knee, straightening your right leg.

Repeat for the desired number of reps.

                <h2>Forward and Backward lunge:</h2>
                <ul>
                    By traveling instead of staying stationary in a lunge, you can better activate your lower body muscles and improve stability, mobility, and balance.

Start with your feet together and step forward, lunging with your right leg.
Push off the forward leg to come back through the starting position, and step back into a backward lunge.
                </ul>

                <h2>Kneeling squad:</h2>
                <ul>
                    Kneeling squats are great for time under tension, or keeping your legs and glutes under continuous work, which adds to the burn.
Directions:

Drop down into a squat position. You won’t stand at all during this move.
Drop your knees down to the ground one at a time so you’re kneeling.
Step your feet back to the ground one at a time, maintaining that squat position.
Repeat as quickly as you can while maintaining good form.
                </ul>

                <h2>Dead bug:</h2>
                <ul>
                    Activate those deep core muscles with a dead bug.

Directions:

Start lying on your back, legs at tabletop, and arms extended in front of you.
In a coordinated motion, drop the heel of your left leg toward the ground and drop your right arm above your head, taking care your lower back stays flat on the ground.
Bring your leg back to tabletop and your arm in front of you, then repeat with the opposite arm and leg.
                </ul>

                <h2>Overhead squat:</h2>
                <ul>
                    Extending your arms overhead can challenge your mobility and range of motion in your upper body, as well as give your lower body the benefits of a squat. It’ll also force you to engage and work your core.

To perform, complete a squat with your arms extended overhead throughout.
                </ul>

                <h2>one - legged pushup:</h2>
                <ul>
                    Lifting one leg will put more weight on your other three limbs, increasing the challenge.

To get it done, assume a pushup position and lift one leg off the ground, then complete the pushup.
                </ul>
